Summary:
  The project we are doing is creating a phone book where you can store contacts as well as add and delete them. The main functions of this are the add, delete, and edit functions. Through these you are able to add your contacts with their name, number, and email. You are able to go back and edit your contacts through the edit contact function as well as delete them if you do not want them in your contacts. Other functions included are the print phonebook, which will show all your contacts, search, recent, which will show the recently visited contacts, and favorites, which will give you your top 5 favorites. The phonebook will be saved to a file whenever you exit out of the program so when you start it up again it will contain the same contacts from before.
  
How to Run:
  In order to run you will need to download the files PhoneBook.h, PhoneBook.cpp, and FinalProjectMain.cpp.You will use the FinalProjectMain.cpp to run it. At first there will be no contacts so I suggest you start by adding contacts before testing the other functions. 

Dependencies and System Requirements:
  There are no third party libraries that are needed for this project. All you need to run it is c++, we have gotten it to work on both codeblocks and on geany. If you choose to run the program on codeblocks the best way for it to work is to create a new project and copy over the text into the necessary areas.
  
Bugs:
  There are no known bugs as of now.
